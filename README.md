# Dijkstraordinary
Dijkstraordinary is a program written in *Java* with a *french GUI*. 
It was made for a first-year student's project in Télécom Paris with another student.
It started in October 2019 and ended in November 2019.

## What does it do?
It is a basic maze solver implementing Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from departure to arrival.
Thus, it is not optimized as many other algorithm can do better than Dijkstra's for maze solving (Using Dijkstra was imposed).

## Features
* Can Save/Open a maze from a text file
* Graphical mouse editor
* Dijkstra algorithm can finds the shortest path from departure to arrival
* Can display the shortest path found and save the solved maze to a text file

## Credits
The textures were taken from the game Minecraft.

* Empty box: Minecraft's sand 
* Wall box: Minecraft's stone brick
* Every other boxes: Minecraft's sand but modified
